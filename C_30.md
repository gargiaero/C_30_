Topic :  Vanishing Pigs -  learn to manipulate a property of a class to give a vanishing effect to pig object under certain conditions. Also learn keyboard events and ASCII values of the keys.

Objectives:

● Remove the pig object from the world when the pig is hit.

 ● Add vanishing effect to the pig. 

● Use keyboard events to attach the bird back to the sling

STEPS:

1. Clone the  link from the previous class. 

   $ git clone https://github.com/whitehatjr/AngryBirdsStage5

2. How do we know that a bird attack has hit the pig ?

   * Probalbly ,when the logs, boxes or the bird touches the pig?

   * Not really, the log is already touching the pig right now. Also a touch doesn't imply it has been sufficiently hit. 

   * When a body is hit, some of its properties will change - like its speed, momentum etc. 

   * For now let's try to output the pig's speed when it is hit by the bird and see how/if it changes. 

   * We are dealing with the pig objects. Which file should we write our code in?  To preserve readability, we should write in pig.js

   *  How can we display the pig’s speed? display() function is called in every frame since it is called inside draw(). 

   * Write the console.log() command to print the pig object's speed on the console before displaying it.

   *  Run the code and hits the pigs with the bird. 

     ```html
     | console.log(this.body.speed); |
     | :---------------------------: |
     | // The pig's speed increases  |
     ```

     

3. Let's use this change in speed of the pig object to decide when to vanish the pig. 

   * We will have to choose a threshold. 

   * We want the pig to be displayed only when the pig's speed is below the threshold. 

   * If the pig's speed is above the threshold, we don't display the pig.

   * What should we do when the speed crosses the threshold? 

   * Just like we added the pig object to the world, we need to remove the pig object from the world when it is hit and crosses a certain speed threshold.

   * We want the pig to vanish gradually not abruptly. 

   * One way to do it is using tint() function in p5. 

   * By changing the number in the tint's argument, we can create a vanishing effect...

   * Tint adds a transparent layer to the image.

   * Before that

     * Create a property inside the Pig Constructor called this.Visibility. 

     * We can tell the computer about how much visible the pig object should be by assigning a number to this.visibility. 

     * Colors / transparency is often measured between 0 to 255. 

     * In Programming we use binary digits. 

     * Also a unit of memory is 1 byte (8 bits). 

     * 0 -> 1 fully OFF byte (00000000) 

     * 255 -> 1 fully ON byte (11111111) 

     * So, what would this.Visiblity = 255 imply?

     * Inside Pig class >>>>>> constructor(), write

       ```
       this.Visiblity = 255;
       ```

     * After removing the object from the world, let's replace the object with the image of the object at the same position. We will slowly disappear the image. Also let's give a tint to the image. The image will be fully visible if the tint() function's 2nd argument is this.Visibility.

     ```
                tint(255,this.Visiblity);
          image(this.image, this.body.position.x, this.body.position.y, 50, 50);
     ```

     

     * We want to give an appearance of the object slowly being removed. 

     * display() function is called in every frame. Let's reduce the visibility by 5 each time and see what happens. 

     * Reduce the visibility of the pig class by 5 each time. 

     *  run the code and Observe.

       ```
         this.Visiblity = this.Visiblity - 5;
       ```

       -  the screen getting stuck after the bird successfully attacks one of the pigs.

     * The screen is getting stuck because the tint visibility setting is being used by all the objects once activated.

     *  how to add a setting and then preserve  previous setting? 

       *  push() and pop()

   ```
   if(this.body.speed < 3){
       super.display();
      }
      else{
        World.remove(world, this.body);
        push();
        this.Visiblity = this.Visiblity - 5;
        tint(255,this.Visiblity);
        image(this.image, this.body.position.x, this.body.position.y, 50, 50);
        pop();
      
   ```

   

4.  Write code so that when a key is pressed, the bird gets attached back to the slingshot and we get one more shot.

   * Just like we had events for mouse triggers like mousePressed, mouseDragged etc; The respective functions get called when a mouse event is triggered.

   *  Similarly we have a keyPressed event. When a key is pressed, the function gets called. Each key is identified by a 'keyCode' -numerical value which we call ASCII value. 

   * Computer understands which key is pressed by associating this numerical value with the key on the keyboard.

   * Look at the value of any key by looking at the ASCII chart. Let's use the key "SPACE" to attach the bird back to the slingshot.

   * What is the value of SPACE?

   * Write the code, inside sketch.js file:

     ```
     function keyPressed(){
         if(keyCode === 32){
         // write the code
         }
     }
     ```

     * We need to write a function inside slingshot.js to attach the bird back to the sling. We need to call this function in our code which is triggered by the press of a SPACE button.

       ​           

       ```
         attach(body){
               this.sling.bodyA = body;
           }
       ```

       

   WHAT WE LEARNT TODAY:

   * ASCII values - Keyboard events 
   * Removing a body from the world
   * Adding transparency to images.
